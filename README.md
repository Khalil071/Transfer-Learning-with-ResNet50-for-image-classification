Transfer Learning with ResNet50 for image classification
This project demonstrates how to apply transfer learning using powerful pre-trained models ResNet50 for image classification. This model is fine-tuned on their respective tasks and can be easily adapted for further use in computer vision applications.

Project Overview:
Image Classification with ResNet50 (image_classification.py)
In this section, we use the ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet for image classification tasks. The ResNet50 model is a deep convolutional neural network designed to handle large-scale image classification tasks with high accuracy.

Example Code:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Load and preprocess the image
img_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'  # Replace with the path to your image
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))  # ResNet50 requires 224x224 images
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

# Make prediction
predictions = model.predict(img_array)

# Decode predictions to class labels
decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]
for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
    print(f"{i+1}: {label} with probability {score:.2f}")
Explanation:
ResNet50: The ResNet50 model is loaded with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. This allows the model to classify images based on the features it has learned from the ImageNet dataset.
Image Preprocessing: The input image is resized to 224x224 pixels, converted into a numerical array, and preprocessed before feeding it into the ResNet50 model.
Predictions: The model predicts the class probabilities for the input image, and the top 3 predictions are decoded to readable class labels.

2: Egyptian cat with probability 0.10
3: tiger cat with probability 0.03
Training and Fine-Tuning
Although the models used in this project are pre-trained on large datasets (BERT on a massive text corpus and ResNet50 on ImageNet), they can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains by retraining the last layers on your custom datasets.


Fine-tuning ResNet50 for Custom Image Classification:
You can also fine-tune ResNet50 for custom image classification tasks by freezing the initial layers and training the final layers on your labeled image dataset.

Results and Evaluation
For image classification, evaluate the top-1 accuracy of the model on a test set of images.

Visualizations (Optional):
You may also plot the predictions using matplotlib to visualize the results of image classification.
